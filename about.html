                <h2>Collector-Led Knowledge</h2>
                <p>We're not a faceless reseller or corporate buyer. At the Gates Wargames is run by people who've been in the tabletop miniatures hobby for years. We know the difference between a well-painted army and a rushed spray job. We understand which models hold value and which don't. That knowledge informs every valuation we make.</p>

                <p>When you contact us about selling your Warhammer collection, you're speaking to someone who knows what a Horus Heresy army looks like, who can spot a rare metal model, and who understands the time that goes into proper painting and basing. We don't use automated pricing tools or generic formulas. Every collection is assessed individually.</p>

                <h2>Experience Across the South East</h2>
                <p>Based in Hampshire, we've worked with collectors across the South East, South West, and into London. We've purchased everything from single-army sales to complete garage clearances. We've travelled for collections that warranted it, and we've given honest feedback when a collection doesn't meet the threshold for purchase.</p>

                <p>That honesty is important. Not every collection is worth buying, and we won't waste your time if we can't offer a fair price. But when we do make an offer, it's based on real market knowledge and a genuine understanding of what you're selling.</p>

                <h2>Why We Do This</h2>
                <p>The second hand Warhammer market is full of lowball offers from people who don't know the hobby, and inflated asking prices from sellers who don't understand current values. We exist to bridge that gap. Fair deals, realistic expectations, and transactions handled by people who actually know what they're looking at.</p>

                <p>Whether you're clearing out old models, upgrading to a new army, or selling a collection you've inherited, we'll give you a straightforward assessment and a fair price. No corporate nonsense, no pushy sales tactics, just collector-to-collector transactions done properly.</p>
